Synopsis: Transaction monitoring and alerts, to assess whether a bank account has been used for money laundering. In other words, this is a helpful tutorial for anyone new to anti-money laundering, or anyone thinking of becoming a money launderer.


## total volume and daily volumes

Is the *volume of transactions* typical for the type and age of business or whether there are any red flags. For example, if it's a long established building contractor, there will be a typical level of transactional activity, which will look very different from, say, a newly formed computer consultancy.

As a rule of thumb, a new business is likely to have fewer *account activities* than a well-established and successful one. 

So is the business transacting on a consistent daily basis or do its transactions seem relatively unpredictable?

For example, a retail business is more likely to have regular payments both in and out, even though it may vary by season or even by day of the week -- compared with a management consultancy, which may be more ad hoc.

Newly formed companies typically require some amount of time before they've built up their client list and substantial volumes of cash flow. If a new commercial bank account suddenly has large volumes flowing through it, this is highly suspicious.


## total and daily values for both debits and credits

A successful business should take in more than it pays out unless it's running at a loss, which means you would expect that the amount you receive by way of invoices would be more than the amount you pay out in invoices. The difference between the two would then be made up of other business expenses, rent, wages and other costs, leaving you hopefully with a surplus at the end.

One of the hallmarks of a "laundromat" scheme is the _rapid movement of funds_ into and out of an account. After all, you don't want to risk your money getting frozen in an account if you happen to get spotted. The idea is to move it as soon as possible.

Look for evenly matched daily credits and debits.

Within the individual transaction amounts, look for amounts consistently just below a threshold like `9,000` or `99,000`, and so on. Because banks often have limits at which their alerts kick in. Some are prescribed by law and others are simply based on the bank's own risk appetite.

If the launderers have someone working inside a bank, they may be aware of these limits and consistently pay just below them. Or they might have guessed the likely limits, or arrived at them through trial and error in accounts that they've set up specifically to test the limits and see whether these get flagged.


## round-numbered amounts in large transactions

Often money launderers are lazy and move money around the system in big round figures. If you examine the average honest business account, big round figures are quite rare -- except maybe when partners or owners draw from the company.

Consistent appearance of *round figure amounts* on a bank statement, unless there are good business reasons for them to appear, are highly suggestive of money laundering.


## closing daily balances, compared with total activity

If money launderers move individual sums in and out in quick succession, consistently across the entire account activity, the *overnight balance* will be very low in comparison to the *total activity*. 

Look at the ratio of average overnight balance to total activity.

A regular customer will usually not virtually empty a very active account overnight each day, but a money launderer often will.


## remitters and receivers of payments

Is there any obvious connection between the *remitters*, the account in question and the *receivers*? If the account's being used for money laundering, it might well be part of the *layering* stage of money laundering.

**Layering**: _moving money rapidly between different accounts and usually different jurisdictions to disguise its origins._

All three elements of the transaction, the remitter, the account holder and the onward receiver, must be under the control of the launderers or otherwise they'd lose their money. They will go out of their way to mask these connections. It's the job of the investigator to find them.


## nature of the business

You wouldn't expect a fine art company to be doing business with the manufacturer of parts for a motor car, or at least not on a regular basis.

You wouldn't expect a firm that's consistently paid by you to consistently also send you money. Some firms pay as if they were suppliers and some firms pay as if they were customers. Normally these are two different populations. It's possible, I guess, that you both send and receive money from the same company, but it wouldn't be common. 


## data exhaust

In this day and age, almost all firms have some sort of Internet presence. The more successful they are, the more likely they'll have some sort of online business.

If you come across a commercial firm that has absolutely no Internet presence at all, that's suspicious.
