Synopsis: Transaction monitoring and alerts, to assess whether a bank account has been used for money laundering. In other words, this is a very helpful tutorial for anyone new to the world of anti-money laundering, or anyone thinking of becoming a money launderer.

* new accounts make large deposits and withdrawals on day one

---

## total volume and daily volumes

Is the *volume of transactions* typical for the type and age of business or whether there are any red flags. For example, if it's a long established building contractor, there will be a typical level of transactional activity, which will look very different from, say, a newly formed computer consultancy.

As a rule of thumb, a new business is likely to have fewer *account activities* than a well-established and successful one. 

So is the business transacting on a consistent daily basis or do its transactions seem relatively unpredictable?

For example, a retail business is more likely to have regular payments both in and out, even though it may vary by season or even by day of the week -- compared with a management consultancy, which may be more ad hoc.


## total and daily values for both debits and credits

A successful business should take in more than it pays out unless it's running at a loss, which means you would expect that the amount you receive by way of invoices would be more than the amount you pay out in invoices. The difference between the two would then be made up of other business expenses, rent, wages and other costs, leaving you hopefully with a surplus at the end.

One of the hallmarks of a laundromat scheme is the _rapid movement of funds_ into and out of an account. After all, you don't want to risk your money getting frozen in an account if you happen to get spotted. The idea is to move it as soon as possible.

Look for evenly matched daily credits and debits.

Within the individual transaction amounts, look for amounts consistently just below a threshold like nine thousand, or ninety nine thousand, and so on. Because banks often have limits at which their alerts kick in. Some are prescribed by law and others are simply based on the bank's own risk appetite.

If the launderers have someone working inside a bank, they may be aware of these limits and consistently pay just below them. Or they might have guessed the likely limits, or arrived at them through trial and error in accounts that they've set up specifically to test the limits and see whether these get flagged.


## round-numbered amounts in large transactions

Often money launderers are lazy and move money around the system in big round figures. If you examine the average honest business account, big round figures are quite rare -- except maybe when partners or owners draw from the company.

Consistent appearance of round figure amounts on a bank statement, unless there are good business reasons for them to appear, are highly suggestive of money laundering.


## average overnight balance
## closing daily balances, particularly compared with total activity

If money launderers move individual sums in and out in quick succession, consistently across the entire account activity, the *overnight balance* will be very low in comparison to the *total activity*. 

Look at the ratio of average overnight balance to total activity.

A regular customer will usually not virtually empty a very active account overnight each day, but a money launderer often will.


## the remitters and receivers of payments

Is there any obvious connection between the remitters, the account in question and the receivers? If the account's being used for money laundering, it might well be part of the *layering* stage of money laundering.

**Layering**: _moving money rapidly between different accounts and usually different jurisdictions to disguise its origins._

It follows that all three elements of the transaction, the remitter, the account holder and the onward receiver, have to be under the control of the launderers because otherwise they've lost their money. 

They will go out of their way to mask those connections, however, and it's the job of the investigator to find them.


And the next one? The nature of the business that each of these elements conducts. Obviously, you wouldn't expect a fine art company to be doing business with the manufacturer of parts for a motor car, or at least not on a regular basis. I mean, they might be buying a painting for the ball drum, but you get my drift.

I do. Anything else? Yes. One other thing that's worth mentioning.

You wouldn't expect a firm that's consistently paid by you to consistently also send you money. So, I mean, you have firms that you pay like suppliers and firms that pay you like customers. And normally those are two different populations.

It's possible, I guess, that you both send and receive money from the same company, but it wouldn't be common. Great. Anything else you can think of? Well, one other thing worth mentioning is that in this day and age, almost all firms have some sort of Internet presence.

And the more successful they are, the more likely they'll have some sort of online business. Well, yes, I mean, even the little corner shops you visit locally these days are listed in in some sort of directory. In fact, knowing we were doing this podcast, I did a little test and every one of the shops in the road next to where I live, and that's just a small through road, were listed on at least one or more Internet sites.

And that's exactly what I'd expect in this day and age. So if you come across a commercial firm, an ostensibly commercial firm that has absolutely no Internet presence at all, that's interesting. It is. 

So let's just just take a step backwards. And so are we saying that if a set of bank statements hits, say, one or more of all of those different red flags you have just defined, it is a sign that all may not be well? Yes, I think red flags are more exponential than cumulative, by which I mean that two red flags represent a bit more than double the concerns of just one red flag. And three is definitely much more than the sum of its parts.

OK, well, with all of that in mind, shall we start applying that logic to one or more of the accounts for which I have the statements in front of me? Graham, let's do that and let's see how many red flags we can spot. OK, right. So I'm going to start with the statements for an account that's in the name of a UK limited liability partnership.

And I'm going to do that for a couple of reasons. One, it is still possible to access a reasonable amount of information about this company because it's in the company's house. And two, LLPs were at the centre of the activity in Tallinn.

We know that thanks to the evidence of whistleblower Howard Wilkinson, who revealed that it was his checks on first one and then a handful of UK LLPs that persuaded him to push ahead with his assertion that something was rotten in the state of Denmark. Well, Estonia, actually. But we had to get that Hamlet quote in somewhere, didn't we? Yes, we did. 

And Ray, I'm still optimistic we'll be able to work in the Tina Turner one, but we'll let our listeners wonder what on earth that means and wait for another episode on another day. Yes, I think so. Meanwhile, if our listeners have any ideas about what it might be, they can always tweet the podcast. 

Tell us more about this account then, Graham. OK, so let's start with what we know about the company. So this LLP was incorporated on the 28th of June 2007.

And just to be clear, as we mentioned in our previous podcast episode, the launching of a laundromat, Danske completed their takeover of Sampo Bank in early 2007. So this LLP was created after that happened. That's absolutely right.

So this was not an inherited problem, not for this entity, at least. And Graham, I know you can't name this organisation publicly, but you know what it is. You've seen the registration details.

Is there anything about the name or those details that give you any kind of clue as to what type of business this firm is involved in? Ray, sadly not. You and I have written in the past about the manner in which a lot of these rather odd LLP names are devised. It has a name which looks entirely unremarkable, but tells you nothing whatsoever about what it does.

OK, yeah, that's certainly part of the pattern. So what do we know about it? Well, we know it was originally registered to a rather grand apartment block in Earl's Court in West London, which is or was home to a large number of very similar limited liability partnerships. And do we know who the designated members were? Yes, we do. 

But I think before we go into that, there may well be people listening who don't necessarily understand what a designated member is for a limited liability partnership. So do you want to take a minute just to explain? Yes, happy to. A designated member is what you have in a limited liability partnership, which is the equivalent of a director in a limited company.

And unlike an ordinary member of a limited liability partnership, the designated member has certain legal responsibilities in respect of keeping accounts, running the partnership and filing reports with Companies House. And there always has to be two of them. They can be legal entities, companies, if you like, and they don't have to be based in the UK, although the limited liability partnership must have a UK registered address like the one based in that apartment in Earl's Court.

Thanks, Ray, that's really helpful. So the two designated members for this LLP were called Ireland and Overseas Acquisitions Limited and Milltown Corporate Services Limited. It's worth noting that they were the designated members for a huge number of LLPs.

In fact, using the really excellent service that's provided by Open Corporates, I found them listed as the designated members for two thousand one hundred and eighty four UK LLPs. Two thousand one hundred and eighty four, Graham. How on earth do you meet your legal obligations for so many at once? Ray, you are so asking the wrong person.

Anyway, over the years, they've given at least two and I think possibly three different incorporation addresses. I think they started out in Ireland, actually, but the ones I know, one is in Tortola in the British Virgin Islands and one is in Belize. And a lot of the LLPs they acted for, although, Ray, I have neither the time nor the motivation to check all two thousand one hundred and eighty four, were registered to that same address in Earl's Court.

OK, so this LLP was incorporated in July 2007. When did it open the account with Danska Estonia? It opened the account on the 19th of October 2007. So within three months of incorporation? Yep. 

And despite the registered address in Earl's Court and the designated members being based in the British Virgin Islands, the trading address on the bank statements is located in the Yaroslavsky district of Moscow. Hmm. Should we start with some basic information? So what was the currency that the account was denominated in? Currencies, Ray.

More than one, Graham. Yes. Swiss francs, Estonian crowns, euros, British pounds, rubles and dollars.

OK, so so in the space of three months, then, this company had become something of a global concern. Well, to be fair, not all of the different currencies started arriving straight away. But, Ray, you just you haven't heard the half of it yet.

Go on, then. Well, the first transactions were in euros and they started shortly after opening the account. So the first two credits arrived on the 2nd of November 2007.

For how much? €984,775 and €579,660, respectively, making a total of €1,564,435. That's not a bad opening balance. No, especially as a further €945,000 odd arrived on the 5th of November and then another €984,000 on the 6th of November and then two more totalling over €1,500,000 arriving on the 7th of November.

Well, how much is that altogether? Ray, it comes to €5,994,660. So in the space of six days, a fraction under €6,000,000 was paid into this new account. Yes, interesting that so many payments were just under a million and the total is just under €6,000,000, don't you think? Very interesting. 

But at least they've got a nice, healthy bank balance. No, they haven't. What do you mean? Well, they were also making payments at the same time.

Go on then. What was the bank balance at the end of this first week of frenetic activity? It was €780,000. What? Yeah, at the end of week one, they received just under €6,000,000 and they paid out just under €6,000,000.

Gosh. And then the dollar started arriving. When? On the 9th of November 2007.

I'm really going to regret asking this. How much was the first credit, Graham? It was for $994,700, Ray. So just under a million in dollars as well now.

Yes. Followed by a further credit, same day, of $450,000 exactly. Both on the same day? Yep. 

A total of $1,444,700. Sounds very familiar. Did they make any payments, Graham? They did, Ray. 

On the same day, the payments totaled $1,444,016.80. In matching amounts? No, in round figure amounts. And by the way, the $16.86 were bank charges. Who were those transfers to? Well, as you know, I can't name names, but there were six payments to four different companies.

All of those four companies were UK LLPs. Three of them were registered to the same address in Earl's Court as the client account, and they had the same two designated members. You are joking.

No, sadly, I'm not. OK, then. After that? Well, on the 12th of November, they received a payment of $986,847.67. And they paid out $987,000 to one of those self-same LLPs, leaving a balance of $520.

And do the bank statements reveal anything about where the money was coming from or what the payments were for? Well, yes, they do. So those last two, for instance, the credit into the account was designated for construction equipment and the debit was designated as for electronic techniques. They don't really go together, do they? No, and it goes on that same way, almost ad infinitum.

So a couple of days later, there was a credit of $991,883.15 for construction equipment and a debit of $992,000 exactly for electronic techniques. And it's like this right through the time the account was open. Yes. 

I mean, to be fair, there is quite a bit of money being moved between the dollar and the euro accounts and back again. But there is also a very significant outflow. What can you tell us about the outflows? They fall into two distinct camps.

They fall into layering transactions and integration transactions. Should I just expand, Graham, on what that means, just to make sure our listeners understand the difference? Yeah, I think, Ray, why don't you? So layering is the process of moving money around, often in a series of complex transactions, in order to disguise the original source. Integration is the process of reintroducing the funds to the real economy in a way that makes them look legitimate and then lets me go and spend or enjoy that money.

If you like, layering is like shuffling the cards and integration is like dealing them. That's a great analogy, Ray. That's absolutely spot on.

So looking at the account, then, how do you differentiate between layering activity, moving money around, and integration activity, taking it out to spend? Well, it's not a precise science, but a large number of the transactions are in round numbers amounts to unknown and often associated entities, whereas others tend to be non round number amounts and they are paid to specific individuals or to known trading entities or institutions. Institutions, Graham, what kind of institutions are they? Well, I've seen, for example, private schools and colleges. There's a payment in the statements I've got for fees for a private college in Gloucestershire.

And then there's lots of payments to individuals which are labelled entrusting of money for the paying of property. And then there are payments to other entities, a good few of which are UK based LLPs or limited companies. And you discovered some interesting facts about the UK LLPs, didn't you? I did. 

Across the six sets of bank statements which I've got, and incidentally, that comes to over five and a half thousand pages of individual transactions, I identified 29 UK LLPs which appear repeatedly throughout those statements. And? Well, of those 29 LLPs, Ray, 18 were registered to the same address in Ellscourt and five more were registered at the same address in Cardiff. And if you check that Cardiff address on Google Street View, unlike the Ellscourt address, which is a very nice mansion flat, the Cardiff address appears to be either an L bar or possibly the flat above.

So 23 of the 29 entities were located at just two different addresses. That's a posh mansion flat in West London and a nail bar in Cardiff or possibly the flat that sits above it. Yes, they do.

And even more astoundingly, 23 of the 29, although not exactly the same 23, had Ireland and Overseas and Milltown Corporate Services as their designated members. OK, hold on. So you're saying that millions and millions of dollars and euros of transactions.

Billions. OK, or billions. Were moved through the accounts of a bunch of UK LLPs, 80 percent of which were either registered to the same address or run by the same people.

Ray, that is exactly what I'm saying. And a lot of these transactions were conducted in round sum amounts. They were. 

Can I give you an example? Oh, please do, Graham. All right. So on the 28th of July 2008, the account I'm looking at made five payments to five different UK LLPs.

Two of them were registered at the Ellscourt address, which is the same address as the account holder, and three at the address in Cardiff. Four of those five, along with the account holder themselves, had Ireland and Overseas and Milltown as their designated members. Wow. 

Not much doubt that they're all connected then. How much were those payments for? So respectively, they were for 50,000 euros, 210,000 euros, 300,000 euros, 320,000 euros and 374,000 euros. Phew. 

Anything else? Yeah, I went through the accounts and I totaled up the payments for just one of those LLPs across the entire history of the account, which is actually about 14 months. OK. And what did it come to? It came to just over 30 million euros.

Wow. And a further eleven and a half million dollars. Second. 

Wow. And they also received money from a second account, I have the statements for, which totaled six million euros and two and a half million dollars, making a grand total received of 36 million euros and 13 and a half million dollars. I mean, that's very nice going in the space of 14 months, were they? I mean, this would have been a well-known, successful company.

No, they were utterly, utterly anonymous, but they did file accounts at Companies House. Did they, Graham? They did, but for 2008, 2009 and 2010. While these payments were all being made.

While these millions of euros and dollars. Yes. OK.

OK. Right. Now, I'm going to have to ask it.

What did the accounts show, Graham? Well, Ryan, in 2008, they showed income of just about 36,000 pounds. And in 2009, sadly, it had dropped to just over 13,000 pounds. And in 2010, down to 12,000 pounds.
